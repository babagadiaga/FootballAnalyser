# FootballAnalyser

This website helps analyse a football and predict the winner based on numerous metrics and artificial intelligence.
It allows teams to be able to see what area of their game they can improve to put the odds in their side and win games.

The website will be composed of a ReactJs frontend and a Java backend.

This is in continuous development and improvment
